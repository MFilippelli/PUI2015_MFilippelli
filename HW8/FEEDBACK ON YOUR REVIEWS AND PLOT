very good reviews, thought out, insightful and helpful 10/10

NOTES ON PLOT 
============
[!alt text](mf3358.png)

the station id is a categorical value, not a continuous one, so it should not be plotted as a position (and the idea of doing a regression on it is odd and really meaningless)

the regression lines are very thick, which does not add to readability. 

in color-blind simulations the colors become indistinguishable, particularly the green

NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===============================


legend obfuscated by the plot

the smoothing choice may show insignificant structure

the plot is simple and generally clear enough

Elixeus
=======

the plot is clear, the label visible. 

the default choice for python large number visualization is questionable and could be changed (the 1e7 at the top is hard to notice

contrast is lost by color blind people

the legend is unclear. "10t" is not explained. the default 3 datapoints for scatter plot should be changes as it is unnecessarily redundant

cindiliu686
===========
the colors are not explained nor is the transparency

for the large numbers on x and y axis a more concise notation should be chosen

the 3d dimension is unnecessary and possibly redundant with the color. 

the 3d dimension makes the readability of the Square footage and of the # of units hard to read away from the edges of the respective axis ranges
