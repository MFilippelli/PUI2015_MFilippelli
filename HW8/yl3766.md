CLARITY - first plot:
          not entirely sure of relationship, might be more clear if square footage was on x-axis and number of residential units on y-axis
          consider renaming title to "Multi-Unit BUildings in ZIP Code 10466" or something similar
          
          second plot:
          needs a title
          not entirely sure of relationship
          
ESTHETIC - first plot:
          scatterplot is fine, consider starting on 0,0 because there are all positive numbers
          
          second plot:
          there is no indication of what different colors mean
          consider different sized spheres for ease of eye and colorblindness compliance
          
HONESTY - (both plots) similar to clarity, the relationship is not clear so it is difficult to determine if manipulation has occured or not
