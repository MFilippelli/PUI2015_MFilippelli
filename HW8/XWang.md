CLARITY - A more specific title is needed, something like "Weekly Swipes for 10 Trip Passes" or something similar
          x-axis - consider something like "date" or "swipes by week"; "week no" (what is there now) would require the weeks to be listed             as 1-200 
          y-axis - consider just "Number of Swipes" and units is needed
          legend - consider using ">14 million" and "< 14 million" so a wide range of audiences can understand
          
ESTHETIC - lines and different sized circles are good; red-blue is a type of colorblindness, consider a more appropriate color scheme

HONESTY - data does not seem distorted in any negative way :-)
