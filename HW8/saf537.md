CLARITY - Mostly clear, consider adding "Citibike" to the title
          x-axis - consider renaming "average age"
          y-axis - consider renaming "frequency of trips"
          
ESTHETIC - line graph is easy to read
          moving the legend to the upper left-hand corner would provide for clearer reading of chart
          blue/green is a type of colorblindness, consider a line treatment such as dashes or a different color scheme
          
HONESTY - there was some manipulation of data (the normalization) but it was not a distortion, it made the point clear
